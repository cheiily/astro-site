## Summary

An idea of a personal landing/resume website had been going around my head for a while but the final push was seeing a befriended developer's small, personal blog built with Hugo. 
This introduced me to the whole concept of static website generators. \
As a form of procrastination from university work, first came the website's layout and much later the content.

What you see now is the second iteration of the website. I decided that I didn't like the theme I chose previously after all and used the opportunity to move to Astro. 
My familiarity with static content generators definitely came in handy, and I was able to customize the template much faster than previously.

Initially, working on this website had proven to be a nice mental break during the extremely busy time of my 5th semester.
It remains a great place to organize deeper insight and personal remarks towards projects, as well as a piece of self-presentation.
I'm also way more content with how this version turned out and don't see any major changes to the template too soon. Maybe except for the ToC, I think it should be pinned on a side panel...
